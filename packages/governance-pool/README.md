## Description

> The governance pool allows for a more streamlined and efficient project management process, ensuring that all deadlines are met.

## Working principles
1. Each project will have its own governance pool, and investor votes will be represented by DAO tokens. 

2. To vote for a project, investors will need to deposit DAO tokens into the project voting pool.
3. The Governance pool will then lock the DAO funds until voting ends. 


## Usage

Run Governance pool locally:

```
npm i
npm run build
npm run deploy:local
```
